Folder: routes

This folder contains the routes that will be accessible through the API 
In our application, we use Express.js for our routing (https://expressjs.com/).

In case if you don't know what 'routes' are, think of them as individual URLs where users can access specific data.
An example would be the route /events will provide you a list of events as a JSON.

In general, each route has at least 4 operations (matching the CRUD concept).
