Folder: model

This folder contains the model for each one of the collections in our database.
In this application, we use MongoDB for our database.
We integrate Mongoose (https://mongoosejs.com/) for creating our models.

Think of models as the 'model' in MVC.

Helpful side notes:

In MongoDB, we call a table as a 'collection'
In MongoDB, we call an entry (row) as a 'document'
